## Cash Donations

Kids on Computers seeks donations and help in a variety of forms. A cash donation of $100 goes a long way toward placing a working computer in front of a child who has never seen one.

* $100 USD will purchase one Raspberry Pi 4 kit.
* $120 USD will pay to ship four laptops to an international location.
* $200 USD will buy a used computer that can be re-purposed with open source software.
* $250 USD buys everything necessary for a complete Raspberry Pi 4 system in a computer lab.

Please donate through our PayPal Giving Fund:

### Is my donation tax-deductable?

Kids on Computers is a registered 501(c)(3). For U.S. taxpayers, a monetary donation may be tax deductible, but you should consult a qualified tax adviser for advice.


### How will my donation be spent?

Your cash donation goes entirely into our general fund. From that fund we purchase computers and peripherals for creating or updating labs. If computer equipment donations don’t provide essential parts for a computer lab, we then have to purchase what we need. We also must pay for shipping computers and computer parts from wherever a donor delivers them to wherever they are needed.

In some cases, we purchased new or used computer equipment within the country where they will be used. It avoids shipping complications, potential problems at customs and it contributes to the host country’s economy. We use money from the general fund or these purchases.


### Corporate Donations

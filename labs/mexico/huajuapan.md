## Escuela 18 de Marzo

This school, located in one of the least affluent parts of the city of Huajuapan de León, is one of the first schools to benefit from our efforts. In 2008 and 2009 parents and the school administrators were enthusiastic about the prospects of having a computer lab for the children. They worked together to build a new room on the school site that was intended specifically to house a computer lab. When the expected computers did not arrive, they turned to Kids on Computers® for help. In 2009 Kids on Computers® installed several donated computers in the new lab.

In May 2011 a team of five Kids on Computers® volunteers visited the school again, bringing more computers, updating software, fixing computers that had problems, and identifying systems that could not be repaired. But, most importantly, they conducted computer training sessions for both students and teachers. Volunteers have visited the school several times since then, addressing problems, updating software, installing new computers, and conducting training.

This school, which thrives today, is one of the finest examples of cooperation among school administration, a very dedicated teacher, concerned parents, eager students, and Kids on Computers®.

## Escuela Emiliano Zapata

Kids on Computers® volunteers first visited this school site in October 2012. The school was vacant, without teachers or students. We had carried some computers to establish a new lab there, but left that day without installing them.

In 2015, Kids on Computers® volunteers installed fifteen laptops at a newly built lab.

## Centro Apostolico Femenino Santo Domingo

This school for girls in Huajuapan de León is one of the first schools to receive a Kids on Computers® computer lab. It is formally known as Centro Apostolico Femenino Santo Domingo, but in conversation we refer to it as The Girls’ School. The school is managed by an order of Catholic nuns and exists to house and educate girls in their adolescent and young adult years. The resident girls come from hostile and threatening domestic environments. While living there they are taught skills that can allow them to live productively and independently without needing to return to the circumstances they experienced earlier.

Kids on Computers® founders who were familiar with Huajuapan de León were aware of this school and the school’s wish to teach computer skills. With considerable help from local volunteers, a room was made available and modified to house a computer lab. Some of the computers transported to Huajuapan de León in 2009 were installed at this school’s lab. The residents and the staff were courteous and very grateful on all our visits there.

When Kids on Computers® volunteers visited the school in October 2012 there had been a change in the school’s administration. The new Mother Superior wanted a different direction for the lab and in the computer technology that was used to train the girls. Her view was in conflict with Kids on Computers® principles and after several meetings we were unable to reach an agreement.

We consider the effort a success while it existed, but we each have gone in divergent directions. We count the Santo Domingo Girls’ School as a former computer lab.
